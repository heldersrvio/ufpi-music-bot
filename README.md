# UFPI Music Bot

An assignment from my Object Oriented Programming class. Our goal was to develop a Telegram bot that showcased the knowledge we acquired throughout the semester in regards to Object Oriented Programming concepts as well as dealing with databases and SQL. 

It was written in Java and I chose Facebook's [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) for Natural Language Processing.

Maven is required to install the dependencies.
